# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide for SUSS AI Backend

## ✅ What's Ready

Your backend is now committed to git and ready for Railway deployment! The following files are properly configured:

- ✅ `railway.json` - Main Railway configuration
- ✅ `backend/railway.json` - Backend-specific configuration  
- ✅ `backend/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- ✅ `backend/src/server.ts` - Express server with health endpoint
- ✅ `backend/src/routes/analysis.ts` - API routes including `/api/v1/health`
- ✅ `.railwayignore` - Excludes unnecessary files
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Railway

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository: `stossthegreat/sussai`
5. Select the branch: `clean-deployment`

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard, go to the "Variables" tab and add these environment variables:

#### 🔑 Required Variables:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

#### 🔧 Optional Variables (for enhanced features):
```
LOG_LEVEL=info
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Deploy

1. Railway will automatically detect your configuration
2. The build process will:
   - Install Node.js dependencies
   - Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
   - Start the server with `npm start`
3. Your API will be available at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

## 🔍 Health Check

Railway will automatically check your health endpoint at:
- `https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/v1/health`

## 📡 API Endpoints

Once deployed, your API will have these endpoints:

- `GET /` - Root endpoint with API info
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Health check
- `POST /api/v1/analyze` - Main analysis endpoint
- `POST /api/v1/whisperfire/scan` - WHISPERFIRE scan
- `POST /api/v1/whisperfire/comeback` - Comeback generation
- `POST /api/v1/whisperfire/pattern` - Pattern analysis

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway logs in the dashboard
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid
4. Check that the health endpoint returns 200

### If health check fails:
1. Verify the server starts correctly
2. Check that port 3000 is accessible
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway** using the steps above
2. **Get your API URL** from Railway dashboard
3. **Update your Flutter app** to use the new API URL
4. **Test the endpoints** to ensure everything works

## 📱 Flutter App Integration

Once deployed, update your Flutter app's API base URL to:
```dart
const String baseUrl = 'https://your-app-name.railway.app';
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ Environment variables are encrypted in Railway
- ✅ API keys are not exposed in code
- ✅ CORS is configured for security
- ✅ Helmet.js provides security headers

Your backend is production-ready! 🚀
